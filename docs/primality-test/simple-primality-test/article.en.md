# Simple primality test

A primality test is a fundamental algorithm in number theory that determines whether a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The simple primality test, while not the most efficient method, provides a straightforward way to check if a number is prime by testing potential divisors.

This article explores a basic implementation of primality testing, its characteristics, and use cases. While more sophisticated algorithms exist for large numbers, understanding this simple approach helps build a foundation for more complex primality testing methods.
