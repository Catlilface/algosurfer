# Erathosthenes sieve

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient and efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. Named after the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene, this method systematically identifies and eliminates composite numbers, leaving only the primes.

This article explores how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works, its implementation, and its performance characteristics. While simple to understand and implement, it remains one of the most efficient ways to generate a list of prime numbers up to a specified bound. We'll examine both its historical significance and its modern applications in computational mathematics.
